* [Windows Host](./windows-host/readme.md)
* [Ubuntu Host](./ubuntu-host/readme.md)

## Legacy Windows Guest Virtual Machines

Virtual Machines are often used to continue to run bespoke legacy software for a USB or Serial Port peripheral device manufactured by a vendor that is out of business or has been made obsolete by the manufacturer and does not have updated drivers or software. This is important when the Original Host Device has failed for example due to a faulty power supply, failed hard drive or failed memory module and cannot be repaired or replaced with new parts. 

A Virtual Machine Guest of the Expected Legacy Versions of Windows Version can be created and the USB or Serial Port Device can be connected to the Virtual Machine. The Drivers and the Software used for the USB or Serial Port Device can be installed in the Virtual Machine.
