## Legacy Windows Guest Virtual Machines

Virtual Machines are often used to continue to run bespoke legacy software for a USB or Serial Port peripheral device manufactured by a vendor that is out of business or has been made obsolete by the manufacturer and does not have updated drivers or software. This is important when the Original Host Device has failed for example due to a faulty power supply, failed hard drive or failed memory module and cannot be repaired or replaced with new parts. 

A Virtual Machine Guest of the Expected Legacy Versions of Windows Version can be created and the USB or Serial Port Device can be connected to the Virtual Machine. The Drivers and the Software used for the USB or Serial Port Device can be installed in the Virtual Machine.

The two most common Windows Version Virtualised are Windows 7 and Windows XP which had a lifespan of 13 and 11 years respectively and detailed guides are created for these Windows Versions:

* [Windows XP Guest](./windows-xp-guest/readme.md)

Windows 8.1 and Windows Vista were not as popular as Windows 7 and Windows XP and were generally seen as more problematic Windows Version with less development of specialised drivers and software for these Windows Versions:
