# VMware Workstation Pro Install Ubuntu

This guide looks at installation of VMware Workstation Pro on Ubuntu 24.04 or 24.10. VMware has recently been acquired by Broadcom and VMware Workstation has been made free for non-commercial use. The previous free lesser products have been depreciated in order to reduce development costs.

## Installing VMware Perquisites

VMware is written using C++ and requires the following perquisite packages such as the GNU Compiler Collection and build essential which is a package group that contains packages required for C++ development. Open up the Terminal and input:

```bash
sudo apt install gcc-12 libgcc-12-dev build-essential
```

## Downloading VMware Workstation

Although a number of improvements have been made in VMware itself. The front-end to the website redirects to the Broadcom website:

* [Broadcom: Download VMware Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion)

There have been a number of issues logging in to the Broadcom website:

<img src='./images/img_004.png' alt='img_004' width='600'/>

If there are issues the backend to the software downloads can be used:

* [VMware Workstation](https://softwareupdate.vmware.com/cds/vmw-desktop/ws/)

Download the compatible version of VMware Workstation Player from VMware. This is in the core folder and has the extensions `.bundle.tar`.

<img src='./images/img_005.png' alt='img_005' width='600'/>

<img src='./images/img_006.png' alt='img_006' width='600'/>

<img src='./images/img_007.png' alt='img_007' width='600'/>

<img src='./images/img_008.png' alt='img_008' width='600'/>

<img src='./images/img_009.png' alt='img_009' width='600'/>

## Installing VMWare Workstation Player

Extract the `.tar` to get to the extracted folder with the `.bundle` file. 

<img src='./images/img_010.png' alt='img_010' width='600'/>

<img src='./images/img_011.png' alt='img_011' width='600'/>

Right click the `.bundle` file and select properties:

<img src='./images/img_012.png' alt='img_012' width='600'/>

Select Executable as Program:

<img src='./images/img_013.png' alt='img_013' width='600'/>

To change permissions to executable input the following command into the terminal with a space (but don't run this command):

```bash
chmod +x 
```

Drag and drop the bundle file into the terminal to complete the command and run:

<img src='./images/img_014.png' alt='img_014' width='600'/>

<img src='./images/img_015.png' alt='img_015' width='600'/>

This command changes the permissions of a file to execution. Now that the file is executable it can be run as a super user. Input the following command with a space (but don't run this command):

```bash
sudo 
```

Drag and drop the bundle file into the terminal to complete the command and run:

<img src='./images/img_016.png' alt='img_016' width='600'/>

VMware Workstation Player is now installed and displays in the start screen: 

<img src='./images/img_017.png' alt='img_017' width='600'/>

Launch VMware Player, accept the license agreement and select Next:

<img src='./images/img_018.png' alt='img_018' width='600'/>

Select Yes and Next:

<img src='./images/img_019.png' alt='img_019' width='600'/>

Opt in or out of the customer experience program and select Next:

<img src='./images/img_020.png' alt='img_020' width='600'/>

To compile the kernel modules (requires the perquisites packages to perform the compiling) and install them system wide, authentication is required. Input your password and select authenticate:

<img src='./images/img_021.png' alt='img_021' width='600'/>

## Configuring Secure Boot

An attempt to launch a VM will fail because access the virtual monitor kernel module vmmon because it is blocked by Secure Boot:

<img src='./images/img_037.png' alt='img_037' width='600'/>

An error message, failed to start monitor device will display:

<img src='./images/img_038.png' alt='img_038' width='600'/>

Secure Boot will block the Virtual Monitor Kernel Module and Virtual Network Adaptor Module. A Machine Owner Key (MOK) must be created which signs these modules. Open the Terminal:

<img src='./images/img_039.png' alt='img_039' width='600'/>

Navigate to Documents in the terminal using the command change directory `cd`:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
```

<img src='./images/img_040.png' alt='img_040' width='600'/>

Create a new directory called mok using the command make directory:

```bash
mkdir mok
```

Navigate to this directory using:

```bash
cd mok
```

<img src='./images/img_041.png' alt='img_041' width='600'/>

Generate a new Machine Owner Key:

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout VMWARE17.priv -outform DER -out VMWARE17.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj "/CN=VMWARE/"
```

<img src='./images/img_042.png' alt='img_042' width='600'/>

The following files will be created:

<img src='./images/img_043.png' alt='img_043' width='600'/>

Sign the kernel module vmmon:

```bash
sudo /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./VMWARE17.priv ./VMWARE17.der $(modinfo -n vmmon)
```

<img src='./images/img_044.png' alt='img_044' width='600'/>

<img src='./images/img_045.png' alt='img_045' width='600'/>

Sign the kernel module vmnet:

```bash
sudo /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./VMWARE17.priv ./VMWARE17.der $(modinfo -n vmnet)
```

<img src='./images/img_046.png' alt='img_046' width='600'/>


Importing the MOK with MOK management system:

```bash
sudo mokutil --import VMWARE17.der
```

<img src='./images/img_047.png' alt='img_047' width='600'/>

In the terminal create a MOK password for example:

```
vmware1234
```

<img src='./images/img_048.png' alt='img_048' width='600'/>

Confirm the password:

```
vmware1234
```

<img src='./images/img_049.png' alt='img_049' width='600'/>

Reboot using:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

<img src='./images/img_050.png' alt='img_050' width='600'/>

The system will reboot to BIOS:

<img src='./images/img_051.png' alt='img_051' width='600'/>

And display MOK management:

<img src='./images/img_052.png' alt='img_052' width='600'/>

Select Enrol MOK:

<img src='./images/img_053.png' alt='img_053' width='600'/>

Select Continue:

<img src='./images/img_054.png' alt='img_054' width='600'/>

Select Yes:

<img src='./images/img_055.png' alt='img_055' width='600'/>

Input the MOK created earlier:

```
vmware1234
```

Select Reboot:

<img src='./images/img_056.png' alt='img_056' width='600'/>
