# Windows XP

XP Mode was a free Windows XP Virtual Machine available for Windows 7 Pro, Windows 7 Ultimate and Windows Enterprise Licenses. Unfortunately it required Windows Virtual PC which is far inferior to VMware Workstation Player. This guide will look at downloading the XP Mode Installer from Microsoft and creating a XP Mode Virtual Machine within VMware Workstation Player.

Note this by default will give a virtual machine that lasts for only 30 Days if carried out on Windows 8.1 Pro or Windows 10 Pro. If carried out on Windows 7 Pro, Windows 7 Ultimate or Windows Enterprise there is an official line of code that can be added to the Virtual machines Configuration File to allow Product Activation.
