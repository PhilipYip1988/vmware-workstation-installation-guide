### 12th-14 Generation Processors

On a 12thâ€“14th Generation Intel processor, certain legacy settings may need to be configured to run older guest operating systems such as Windows XP.

Legacy CPU settings:

```
cpuid.0.eax = "0000000X"
cpuid.1.ecx = "00000001"
```

These settings help emulate older CPU instructions that XP expects.

Legacy monitor / virtualization settings

```
mks.enableVulkanRenderer = "FALSE"
```

This disables the Vulkan renderer, forcing VMware to use a more compatible DirectX/software renderer.

Legacy monitor / virtualization settings:

```
monitor.virtual_exec = "hardware"
monitor.virtual_mmu = "software"
```

These settings ensure proper CPU and MMU handling for legacy guests.
