# Windows 2000

## Windows 2000 ISO

Windows 2000 is considered abandonware and the Windows 2000 ISO and Product Key can be obtained from WinWorld:

* [WinWorld](https://winworldpc.com/library/operating-systems)

## VMware Tools ISO

* [VMware Tools 10.0.12](https://packages.vmware.com/tools/releases/10.0.12/windows/)

## WSUS Offline Update

The last version of WSUS Offline Update to support Windows 2000:

* ~~[WSUS Offline Update](https://download.wsusoffline.net/)~~

This no longer works as Microsoft removed the downloads WSUS Offline updates uses from their servers.

  <summary>Archive.org</summary>

The Website Archive.org appears to host the ISO created from WSUS Offline Update before Microsoft removed Windows Vista downloads from their download servers:

* [WSUS Offline Update Windows 2000 (Windows 2000=w2k-enu)](https://archive.org/details/wsusoffline-eol-windows)

I have tested installation of the ISO in a Virtual Machine but as this is an unofficial source and should be used with caution.
