# VMware Workstation Player

Recent VMware Workstation updates are optimized for modern hardware and operating systems, with official support generally starting from 11th Generation Intel processors (or equivalent) and focusing on current host/guest platforms such as Windows 11 Version 25H2 and Ubuntu 25.10.

Legacy operating systems, such as Windows XP or Windows 7, may still run but are considered unsupported, with compatibility and performance not guaranteed and often reduced. These operating systems often run better on older VMware versions. Unfortunately the older VMware versions only support the host Windows version and processor generation available at the time they were released.

Moreover the performance of Windows 10 builds degraded with each build past Windows 10 Version 1709 on these older processors, which is why Windows 11 was released with substantially elevated system requirements.

For optimal performance of a Windows XP Offline Virtual Machine e.g. for running a legacy scientific instrument therefore requires a careful match of processor generation, Windows 10 version and VMware version:

|Windows Host OS|Windows Guest OS|Host Processor Generation|VMware Version|
|---|---|---|---|
|Windows 10 Version 1709|Windows XP|6-7th Gen Intel|Workstation Player 15.5|
|Windows 11 Version 25H2|Windows XP|8th-11th Gen Intel|Workstation Player 15.5|
